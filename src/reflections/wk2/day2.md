## Intro to JS > JavaScript Functions and answer the following questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

-One way to write a function is through declaration. This method acts differently from others in that it is hoisted allowing it to be used before being defined.
-another is by a function expression, assigning a function equal to a variable.This acts differntly in that it is not hoisted and cannot be used undefined
-the third way to write a function is by arrow function expression. the difference in this method is that it does not create its own this value

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are used for defining a function, while arguments are values used to invoke a function.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

A higher order function is when a function accepts another function as a parameter.an example could be using array.push method within another function.
