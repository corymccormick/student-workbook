# # Intro to JS > Var, let and const and answer the following questions

What is Scope ?
 Scope is the space in code where a variable are defined and useable.

What is Hoisting ?
Hoisting is when variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
- I might use Let in the case I would need to redefine a variable such as in a loop  
-Use const in a case where the variable will not need to be redeclared, possibly in the case of creating an object
-use var in a case that you need to declare a variable that is within global scope
