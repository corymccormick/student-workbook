## Chrome Developer Tools and answer the following questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

-using console.log() gives you the ability to test functions and  see the value of a variable at the time of when the the log was called

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

  The elements tab allows you to see the breakdown of all your html/css within your code.This tab can be useful in debugging by being able to edit elements on the page quickly and efficiently, apply or remove css classes, and add in or alter properties of css.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

  A more efficient way of debugging your code would be to use the javascript debugger pane within the sources tab.
