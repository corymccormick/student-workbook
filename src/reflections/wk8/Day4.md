# # Working In a Professional Environment > Testing in Vue and answer the following questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
The three types of testing are unit testing allowing for testing on individual units of code in isolation. Component testing provides the ability to test that componets mounted to the dom are working, and end to end testing allows us to see what happens when users use our applications.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I think that end to end testing method might be most useful in that it allows us to see how our application is functioning.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
I think that component tests are possibly least useful.
