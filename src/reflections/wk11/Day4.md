# Day 4

# # Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.
 
Moving towards the end of this course my concerns are utilizing my time well, and working thru logical coding issues. I plan to manage my time by time boxing 20 minutes when I get stuck before fomulating a well thought out question for a T.A. Up to this this point in the course what I have enjoyed most is trying to work and learning along with others in such projects as kanban and our capstone.
