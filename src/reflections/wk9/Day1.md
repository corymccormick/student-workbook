# Day 1 

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
In this project we are using Vue.js, html, css, mongoDB with mongoose, and putting agile principles to practice.

2. What went well so far?
 So far collaborating as a team to develop our figma, lucid chart and writing our initial back end CRUDs as a team has gone well.  

3. What would you do differently? Why?
If we could do something differently it might have been breaking into paired programming earlier because it would have helped us move along a bit more quickly by breaking down tasks into smaller tasks even though we all wanted to be part of a specific process of the developing our application.
