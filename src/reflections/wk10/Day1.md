 # # Foundations of C# > C# Data Types and answer the following questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

The three categories of data type are value, reference and pointer. They are different in how they treat its value.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
The value-type data types are bool, char, and int. The differences from javaScript is that the value remains unchanged even after running thru a method that may do so. 

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types get stored in memory by creating a refernce point to a location that holds the data's value. This differs from value types in that it is not stored within its own memory space.
