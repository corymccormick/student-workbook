# Day 1

## Asynchronous Code > Callback Hell and answer the following questions
1. What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?
  
  Some of the signs of call back hell might be the code appearing in an pyramid shape along with lots of }) at the end. The causes of callback hell are poor coding practices and cause of callback when people try to write JavaScript in a way where execution happens visually from top to bottom 

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
  
  The asynchronous means it wil take some time not returning an immediate result, callbacks are involved in that async function in that they may use a callback.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell.
  
  -Keep your code shallow, by hoisting your functions
  -modularize, create reusable code and placing them in a module
  -handle everysingle error, run $standard to see every callback with an error an error in your code.
